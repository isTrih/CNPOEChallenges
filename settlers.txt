# Settlers of Kalguur Challenges
Please get in touch through [Github](https://github.com/CraniumViolence/craniumviolence.github.io) or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/TrainCarMoney) if any information here is incorrect, absent or you simply have better strategies or information!

The guide is just a list for day 1, for obvious reasons. It'll be worked on over the course of the first days to completion. Pull requests etc. are welcome if you wish to contribute!

This guide makes the assumption that you have a baseline understanding of Path of Exile and does not include complex instructions for a lot of aspects such as explaining what a mechanic is (with the obvious exception of current league or new mechanics getting more attention).

Ruthless challenges are also here at the bottom until the league starts.

# 1 Beginner's Basics
## Very Easy
Complete each of the following tasks.
- Equip a magic flask
- Use an Orb of Alchemy

Basically free but they are making you actually do Fetid Pool.

## Very Easy
Complete each of the following Settlers of Kalguur tasks.

Free from simply interacting with the league content.

# 3 Peddler's Produce I

- Have a total of 1,000 of any Crop in your Kingsmarch Stockpile at once
- Disenchant an item

Nothing about the mechanic is obvious yet, it's very unlikely this is hard or complex due to its challenge placement.

- Act 7: Arakaali, Spinner of Shadows

# 9 Atlas Augmentations
## Very Easy
Complete any three of the following League Mechanic encounters the specified number of times.
- Defeat Essence monsters x 30
- Open Strongboxes x 30
- Activate Shrines x 30
- Defeat Harbingers x 30
- Defeat Possessed Monsters x 30
- Defeat Rogue Exiles x 30
- Defeat Rare Beyond Monsters x 30

Nothing complex, you will very likely finish this while doing normal atlas progression or while doing later grinds while specced into these mechanics.

# 10 Meaningful Mechanics
## Very Easy
Complete any four of the following League Mechanic encounters the specified number of times.
- Complete Breaches x 30
- Complete Abysses x 30
- Complete Expeditions x 30
- Harvest Plots x 100
- Complete Legion Encounters x 30
- Open Smuggler's Caches x 30
- Pass through Mirrors of Delirium x 30
- Complete Ultimatum Waves x 200

Nothing complex, you will very likely finish this while doing normal atlas progression or while doing later grinds while specced into these mechanics.

# 11 Proven Professionals
## Very Easy
Complete any two of the following Master Mission encounters in Red or Purple Tier Maps the specified number of times.
- Niko Missions x 30
- Einhar Missions x 30
- Jun Missions x 30
- Alva Missions x 30

Red Maps but no tier requirement, spec into them on the Atlas and you can get 100% chance or simply use their Scarabs.

# 12 Refined Reagents
## Unknown
Have at least the specified amount of the following Resources in your Kingsmarch Stockpile at once.
- 1,000 Wheat
- 1,000 Corn
- 1,000 Pumpkin

- 1,000 Petrified Amber Bars
- 1,000 Bismuth Bars
- 1,000 Verisium Bars
- 20,000 Thaumaturgic Dust
	- Disenchant Equipment

Very unlikely to be complex, the wording implies you need to have it actively amassed so might need you to chill on spending if you are wanting it early.

# 13 Crafty Currency
## Very Easy
Use each of the following Currency items. Using Crafting Bench options also count towards this challenge.
- Orb of Transmutation
- Orb of Augmentation
- Orb of Alteration
- Orb of Chance
- Orb of Alchemy
- Orb of Scouring
- Orb of Fusing
- Jeweller's Orb
- Chromatic Orb
- Orb of Annulment
- Regal Orb
- Chaos Orb
- Exalted Orb
- Blessed Orb
- Divine Orb

Incredibly straight forward, the crafting bench counting makes it more likely you can use them on something useful for yourself or potentially others to recoup some cost.

# 14 Overwhelming Opposition
## Easy
Defeat 500 Map Bosses.

Historically maps with multiple bosses such as City Square have counted as multiple of these. There's also a lot of ways to add more Map Bosses in general with scarabs, shouldn't be too grindy but is probably still around 100 maps for most people.

# 15 Potent Pantheon
## Very Easy
Fully upgrade any single Major and Minor Pantheon Power.
- Major Pantheon Power
- Minor Pantheon Power

Pretty straight forward, Divine Vessels are much rarer than you might expect so it can take a while naturally but is very likely to happene before a lot of other challenges.

# 16 Unbelievable Undertakings
## Easy
### Buyable
Complete any four of the following encounters where the area level is 81 or higher.
- Breachstones x 5
	- Base Breachstones are Level 81 by default and not terribly hard to complete
- Abyssal Depths x 5
	- Spec into abyss, run it
	- Should also be fairly profitable from the Uniques
- Logbooks with at least 10 Remnants active x 5
	- Very choose your own difficulty and should be pretty easy, bad Logbooks are also very cheap
- Tier 4 Harvest Seeds x 5
	- Crop Rotation can make these more likely
	- Harvest Scarab of Cornucopia forces Tier 4 spawns when possible
- Domains of Timeless Conflict with at least 25 rewards x 3
	- Not too hard, four emblems baseline is level 81
	- You can obviously just buy slots for this too
- Blueprints with 4 revealed wings x 5
	- A bit terrible compared to the other options if you aren't investing into Heist by default
- Simulacrum Waves x 60
	- Waves, not completed Simulacrums
- Trialmaster fights x 3
	- Ultimatum Scarab of Dueling forces him but you still need to complete all the waves
- Blighted or Blight Ravaged Maps x 5
- All Rituals in Maps with at least one Blood-filled Vessel applied x 15

Shouldn't be terribly hard, obvious low stress options are Blighted Maps, Abyssal Depths, Logbooks and Breachstones. A lot of options can be purchased as slot services.

# 17 Sublime Starlight
## Unknown
### Buyable
Use the following Runes in Runesmith Crafting.
- Sun Rune
- Bound Rune
- Life Rune
- War Rune
- River Rune
- Bounty Rune
- Journey Rune
- Mountain Rune
- Time Rune
- Power Rune

You can trade for all of these, they should be in order of rarity. Not obvious how rare each of them are as of the time of writing.

# 18 Achieve Ascension
## Very Easy
Use the Ascendancy Device in each of the following Labyrinths.
- The Labyrinth
- The Cruel Labyrinth
- The Merciless Labyrinth
- The Eternal Labyrinth

Free, simply progressing to the endgame gets you this.

# 19 Divined Destiny
## Easy
Complete any three of the following Divination Card tasks.
- Open Diviners Strongboxes x 5
- Turn in sets of Divination Cards x 50
- Complete Rare Tier 11 or higher Maps with at least one Divination Scarab applied x 25
- Scry a Map

This isn't that hard, the Diviners Strongboxes and Nameless Seer are probably going to be the issue if anything. You can presumably buy the strongbox opening.

# 20 Peddler's Produce II
## Easy
Complete vendor recipes to receive each of the following items. A vendor recipe is when you trade a specific combination of items to a vendor, not when you buy items from their purchase screen.
- Prismatic Ring
	- Vendor all three types of Two-Stone Ring at once
- Orb of Fusing
	- Vendor a 6-link
- Regal Orb
	- Vendor three of a rare with the same name at 20% quality
	- Vendor a Chaos Orb recipe with the item level of all items above 75
		- Helmet, Body Armour, Gloves, Boots, Belt, Amulet, Two Rings and a weapon pair or two handed weapon.
- Grasping Mail or Loreweave
	- Tedious but guaranteed, you need to vendor a full inventory of Unique Rings or a full inventory of Breach Rings to get one of these
	- You can trade for the rings but it will obviously suck a bit
	

# 21 Chaotic Creations
## Very Easy
Use a Chaos Orb on any five of the following item base types while they are Item Level 83 or higher.
- Experimented
	- Heist Bases
	- [See all options](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Experimented_base_type)

	- Hypnotic Eye Jewel
- Expedition
	- Ward Bases

- Cluster Jewel
	- Delirium drop

# 22 Gilded Goals
## Easy
Have at least 250,000 gold in the Kingsmarch Treasury at once.

Notable in that it's 'at once' which implies it should all be in your treasury at the same time.

# 23 Remarkable Realms
## Easy
Complete each of the following Unique Maps.
- Vaults of Atziri
    - ![divination card][div-card] Treasure Hunter
    - ![divination card][div-card] The Wolf's Legacy
- Maelström of Chaos
- The Coward's Trial
- Acton's Nightmare
- Poorjoy's Asylum
    - ![has divination card][div-card] The Dreamland
- Mao Kun
    - ![has divination card][div-card] Scholar of the Seas
- Oba's Cursed Trove
- Olmec's Sanctum
- Death and Taxes
- Whakawairua Tuahu
- The Vinktar Square
- Caer Blaidd, Wolfpack's Den

    - ![has divination card][div-card] The Professor
- Hallowed Ground
- The Twilight Temple
    - ![has divination card][div-card] The Twilight Moon
- Pillars of Arun
- Doryani's Machinarium

Spamming **Singular Scouting Reports** rolls Unique Maps on Kirac, this can include higher tier maps in lower tiers resulting in very easy versions of bosses.

You can also use **Comprehensive Scouting Report** that drop when using the **Planar Tactician** Atlas node which can also roll **Doryani's Machinarium** which is the most expensive unique map generally.

Some Unique Maps have their own divination cards otherwise you can turn in sets of **The Encroaching Darkness** or simply buy the maps on trade.

Still includes Doryani's Machinarium which can end up fairly pricey for a single throw away unique map with a bad reward pushing it slightly out of the 'Very Easy' rating.

# 24 Sanctified Scarabs I
## Normal
Complete Maps with 500 Scarabs. Each Scarab applied to maps counts towards this Challenge.

Should mostly complete naturally over time as long as you use scarabs, you unlock new slots for doing a T17 and for a Maven 10 Way pushing it from three scarabs to five maximum at once.
- 167 maps with 3 Scarabs each
- 125 maps with 4 Scarabs each
- 100 maps with 5 Scarabs each

# 25 Gleaming Gems
## Easy
Complete each of the following Gem tasks.
- Level gems to level 20 x 10
	- You can finish this naturally by just playing the game and sticking gems in every slot
	- You can level things in equipment swaps too
- Use Gemcutter Prisms x 40
	- Not terribly hard, might push the prices of GCP up a bit
	- GCPs can be obtained by vendoring a 20% quality gem or any combo of Gems with 40% quality
		- Each combo needs to add up to 40% which is why sometimes it feels like you have underflow or overflow
- Turn in a divination card set that rewards a Level 21 and/or 23% Quality Gem
    - ![][div-card] The Skeleton (6 stack)
    - ![][div-card] Rite of Elements (5 stack)
    - ![][div-card] The Bitter Blossom (3 stack)
- Use the Divine Font in the Endgame Labyrinth x 10

# 26 Cross Contamination
## Easy
Complete any four of the following past league content encounters.
- Defeat a Harbinger while you are in a Breach
	- Any harbinger, so you can use all sources of them without issue
	- **Heavy Breach** extends Breach encounters.
    - **Scarabs** can add additional Breaches.
	- Vaal Portal might work but is expensive
- Defeat a Unique Map Boss that is Possessed while in a Ritual	
	- This is literal, you need it to get Possessed while in the ritual itself
	- There is a ritual that spawns Tormented Spirits and Scarabs for more in the wild
	- You can do this easily by using a Shore Map and kiting the boss into a ritual, they release a tormented spirit at low HP
		- Kiting can be awkward, try to maintain a path free of obstacles to kite him along, rocks etc. can cause him to retreat or wander off
- Defeat a Breachlord while affected by a Shrine
	- Spamming Breach and Shrines should get this without much problem as you 
- Defeat a Blight Boss while Delirious
	- Scarabs can force Blight Bosses
	- Maps can be made Delirious with orbs or the Atlas can make them last forever
- Defeat a Delirium or Beyond Boss while in the Sacred Grove
	- A bit RNG, stacking beyond and delirium at the same time probably gets you the best hopes
- Defeat a Syndicate Member that is Possessed
	- Not sure immediately if there's an easy means of this

- Reach Depth Level 400 in your Azurite Mine
- Capture Red Beasts x 400
- Complete Betrayal Safehouses x 40

# 29 Sanctified Scarabs II
## Easy
Complete 75 Rare Maps with at least 4 scarabs applied while the Maps have at least 80% Item Quantity and are at least Tier 16.

Four Scarabs makes it a bit expensive but there's a lot of cheap scarabs and as long as you can run T16s it shouldn't be too bad. T17s are likely to always count for this.

You can use the Atlas's Item Quantity nodes to make it easier and basically allow alch and go with the extra +% Item Quantity from there and the Map Device itself.
