# Settlers of Kalguur Challenges
Please get in touch through [Github](https://github.com/CraniumViolence/craniumviolence.github.io) or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/TrainCarMoney) if any information here is incorrect, absent or you simply have better strategies or information!

This guide makes the assumption that you have a baseline understanding of Path of Exile and does not include complex instructions for a lot of aspects such as explaining what a mechanic is (with the obvious exception of current league or new mechanics getting more attention).

# Actual Challenges
They aren't revealed or datamined yet, so I can't write any information on them!

- Can I offer you a nice ![has divination card][div-card] **Carrion Crow** in this trying time? 

# Unlocks
Unlike the most recent leagues you can unlock five separate types of MTX this time around. There are no tiers for the unlocks and you only need to complete 36/40 instead of 38/40 as with tiered rewards.

At 12 challenge completion you can unlock the Runebind Weapon Effect.

At 24 challenge completion you can unlock the Rune Character Effect.

At 32 challenge completion you can unlock the Kalguuran Cloak.

At 34 challenge completion you can unlock the Verisium Knight Unique Finisher Effect.

At 36 challenge completion you can unlock the Kingsmarch Portal.
