- Warden of the Maji x8
- Warlock of the Mists x8

You can farm the first 6 points in Act 10 at any point which can be faster than running maps. The final two points come from completing a T14+ King in the Mists while you are using that ascendancy.

You only need to complete one of the three.

# 23 Remarkable Realms
## Easy
Complete each of the following Unique Maps.
- Vaults of Atziri

- Pillars of Arun
- Doryani's Machinarium

Spamming **Singular Scouting Reports** rolls Unique Maps on Kirac, this can include higher tier maps in lower tiers resulting in very easy versions of bosses.

Not Very Easy as it still includes Doryani's Machinarium which is fairly pricey for a single throw away unique map with a bad reward.

Some Unique Maps have their own divination cards otherwise you can turn in sets of **The Encroaching Darkness** or simply buy the maps on trade.

# 24 Enhanced Equipment
## Very Easy
Equip any eight of the following types of equipment.
- Enchanted
- Synthesized
- Fractured
- Influenced
- Mirrored
- Crafted
- Corrupted
- Qualitied
- Veiled
    - Literally veiled, equip it before unveiling

Straight forward. Enchanted will be covered by Anointed with the Labyrinth changes. You can buy cheap items to cover all of these but you will likely encoutner them naturally by the time you are done with other challenges.

You only need to complete five of the seven.

- King in the Mists' Ritual Grounds

This is simply finding things in the league mechanic. There's nothing to guarantee the spawns and you will simply have to do a lot of them.

There's no level limit but it's possible some of these may only spawn after T11s or similar.

Complete Master missions in Maps that are Tier 16 with at least 80% Item Quantity the specified number of times.

Straight forward mapping while using masters.

The 20% Quantity from Quality, the 30% quantity from the Atlas Tree (Wandering Path) and 8% from the map device all count towards the quantity requirement.

For Kirac, you can use Wandering Path to get +40% Quantity from Quality.

Be sure to keep in mind that this is **completing missions**, not the map!

The non-uber bosses aspirational content, easy enough to buy carries or kills if you aren't confident in the content.

Heist will need you to actually engage with Heist as you will need levelled Rogues.

Only four of the seven are required.

# 39 Peak Pinnacles
## Hard
### Buyable

## Hard
### Grind Heavy
Complete any four of these encounters the specified number of times.

    - Pure Chayula and other higher end Breachstones
    - Coward's Trial
    - T15 Beachheads

- Defeat Rare or Unique monsters with Types of Wisps in Tier 16 maps x500
    - Per type, if a mob is solely 'Vivid Empowered' it will grant one towards this.

It's the large scale grind challenge. You probably already know if you are going to do this and what you are getting into.

It's not too bad in the grand scheme of things, the Rare mods and Rare Wisps overlap after you are the point of T16s every map. Skipping Level 100 is very viable.
